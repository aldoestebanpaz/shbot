Shbot is an IRC bot that runs shell code. It is a fork of evalbot
(http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/evalbot/).

To run shbot, you need an initramfs image and a kernel, which you can find here:
https://github.com/geirha/shbot-initramfs/releases

Save the files as `shbot.cpio.gz` and `shbot-kernel`, then run `make`
